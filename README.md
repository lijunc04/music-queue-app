#Music Queue App (Still thinking about a name for this lol)
By Lijun Cai
Project Start Date: Feb 15, 2024

###What is this app (or, at this stage, what this will become)?
This app aims to improve the experience of music playing in any public events, a prom, a party, dining halls, **anything you can think of!** Event hosters create an "event", which attendees can join by scanning the QR code or entering the invite code generated. By joining the "event", the attendees can choose songs they want the host to play and add them to the event playlist. The app will then play all the songs in the playlist.

###How is this built?
Expo x React Native only as of now. Planning to use Deezer api for music & song stuff. Still deciding databases for the backend.

###When will this be released?
Really depends on my professors (I'm taking 5 courses this semester)... Hopefully around May/June.

###Plans after release?
Testing the app with one of the dining halls at my university. It would be a great way to attract users and receive tons of user feedback.

###Commit Descriptions (more detailed version than the -m)
